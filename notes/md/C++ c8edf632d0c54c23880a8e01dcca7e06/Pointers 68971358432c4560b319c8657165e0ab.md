# Pointers

A pointer in C++ is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. It allows us to work with memory locations directly, which can be useful for various programming tasks. In this document, we will discuss pointers in detail.

## Declaring Pointers

To declare a pointer, we use the `*` operator. The syntax is:

```cpp
type *var-name;
```

Here is an example:

```cpp
int *ptr;
```

This declares a pointer named `ptr` that can point to an integer variable.

> The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.

## Initializing Pointers

A pointer can be initialized with the address of a variable using the `&` operator. For example:

```cpp
int num = 5;
int *ptr = &num;
```

This initializes the pointer `ptr` with the address of the `num` variable.

## Dereferencing Pointers

Dereferencing a pointer means accessing the value stored in the memory location pointed to by the pointer. We use the `*` operator to do this. For example:

```cpp
int num = 5;
int *ptr = &num;

cout << *ptr << endl; // Output: 5
```

Here, `*ptr` gives us the value stored in the memory location pointed to by `ptr`, which is `5`.

There are few important operations, which we will do with the pointers very frequently. **(a)** We define a pointer variable. **(b)** Assign the address of a variable to a pointer. **(c)** Finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator `*` that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand.

Here is a complete example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main () {
   int  var = 20;   // actual variable declaration.
   int  *ip;        // pointer variable

   ip = &var;       // store address of var in pointer variable

   cout << "Value of var variable: ";
   cout << var << endl;

   // print the address stored in ip pointer variable
   cout << "Address stored in ip variable: ";
   cout << ip << endl;

   // access the value at the address available in pointer
   cout << "Value of *ip variable: ";
   cout << *ip << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

## Null Pointers

It is always a good practice to assign the pointer NULL to a pointer variable in case you do not have exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a **null** pointer.

The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries, including iostream. Consider the following program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
int main () {
   int  *ptr = NULL;
   cout << "The value of ptr is " << ptr ;

   return 0;
}
```

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −

```
The value of ptr is 0
```

## \***\*Array of Pointers\*\***

There may be a situation, when we want to maintain an array, which can store pointers to an int or char or any other data type available. Following is the declaration of an array of pointers to an integer −

```cpp
int *ptr[MAX];
```

This declares **ptr** as an array of MAX integer pointers. Thus, each element in ptr, now holds a pointer to an int value. Following example makes use of three integers which will be stored in an array of pointers as follows

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
const int MAX = 3;

int main () {
   int  var[MAX] = {10, 100, 200};
   int *ptr[MAX];

   for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
      ptr[i] = &var[i]; // assign the address of integer.
   }

   for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
      cout << "Value of var[" << i << "] = ";
      cout << *ptr[i] << endl;
   }

   return 0;
}
```

> In many cases, a pointer and an array can be used interchangebly.

## \***\*Pointer to Pointer\*\***

A pointer to a pointer is a form of multiple indirection or a chain of pointers. Normally, a pointer contains the address of a variable. When we define a pointer to a pointer, the first pointer contains the address of the second pointer, which points to the location that contains the actual value. We must declare this as

```cpp
int **var
```

When a target value is indirectly pointed to by a pointer to a pointer, accessing that value requires that the asterisk operator be applied twice, as is shown below in the example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main () {
   int  var;
   int  *ptr;
   int  **pptr;

   var = 3000;

   // take the address of var
   ptr = &var;

   // take the address of ptr using address of operator &
   pptr = &ptr;

		// take the value using pptr
    cout << "Value of var :" << var << endl;
    cout << "Value available of ptr :" << ptr << endl;
    cout << "Value available at *ptr :" << *ptr << endl;
    cout << "Value available at pptr :" << pptr << endl;
    cout << "Value available at *pptr :" << *pptr << endl;
    cout << "Value available at **pptr :" << **pptr << endl;
   return 0;
}
```

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −

```
Value of var :3000
Value available of ptr :0x7ffc8ddeb004
Value available at *ptr :3000
Value available at pptr :0x7ffc8ddeb008
Value available at *pptr :0x7ffc8ddeb004
Value available at **pptr :3000
```

# Pointer Arithmetic

A pointer is an address which is a numeric value; therefore, you can perform arithmetic operations on a pointer just as you can a numeric value. There are four arithmetic operators that can be used on pointers: ++, --, +, and -.

Pointer arithmetic is the manipulation of pointers using arithmetic operations. We can add or subtract an integer value from a pointer to move it to a different memory location. For example:

```cpp
int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int *ptr = arr;

cout << *ptr << endl; // Output: 1

ptr++; // Move the pointer to the next memory location

cout << *ptr << endl; // Output: 2

```

Here, `ptr` is initially pointing to the first element of the `arr` array. We use the `*` operator to print the value stored in that location, which is `1`. We then increment `ptr` by one, which moves it to the next memory location in the array. We use the `*` operator again to print the value stored in that location, which is `2`.

## \***\*Incrementing a Pointer\*\***

The following program increments the variable pointer to access each succeeding element of the array:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
const int MAX = 3;

int main () {
   int  var[MAX] = {10, 100, 200};
   int  *ptr;

   // let us have array address in pointer.
   ptr = var;

   for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
      cout << "Address of var[" << i << "] = ";
      cout << ptr << endl;

      cout << "Value of var[" << i << "] = ";
      cout << *ptr << endl;

      // point to the next location
      ptr++;
   }

   return 0;
}
```

## **Decrementing a Pointer**

The same considerations apply to decrementing a pointer, which decreases its value by the number of bytes of its data type as shown below −

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
const int MAX = 3;

int main () {
   int  var[MAX] = {10, 100, 200};
   int  *ptr;

   // let us have address of the last element in pointer.
   ptr = &var[MAX-1];

   for (int i = MAX; i > 0; i--) {
      cout << "Address of var[" << i << "] = ";
      cout << ptr << endl;

      cout << "Value of var[" << i << "] = ";
      cout << *ptr << endl;

      // point to the previous location
      ptr--;
   }

   return 0;
}
```

## **Pointer Comparisons**

Pointers may be compared by using relational operators, such as ==, <, and >. If p1 and p2 point to variables that are related to each other, such as elements of the same array, then p1 and p2 can be meaningfully compared.

The following program modifies the previous example one by incrementing the variable pointer so long as the address to which it points is either less than or equal to the address of the last element of the array, which is `&var[MAX - 1]`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
const int MAX = 3;

int main () {
   int  var[MAX] = {10, 100, 200};
   int  *ptr;

   // let us have address of the first element in pointer.
   ptr = var;
   int i = 0;

   while ( ptr <= &var[MAX - 1] ) {
      cout << "Address of var[" << i << "] = ";
      cout << ptr << endl;

      cout << "Value of var[" << i << "] = ";
      cout << *ptr << endl;

      // point to the previous location
      ptr++;
      i++;
   }

   return 0;
}
```

# Pointers and Function

## \***\*Passing Pointers to Functions\*\***

C++ allows you to pass a pointer to a function. To do so, simply declare the function parameter as a pointer type.

Following a simple example where we pass an unsigned long pointer to a function and change the value inside the function which reflects back in the calling function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ctime>

using namespace std;
void getSeconds(unsigned long *par);

int main () {
   unsigned long sec;
   getSeconds( &sec );

   // print the actual value
   cout << "Number of seconds :" << sec << endl;

   return 0;
}

void getSeconds(unsigned long *par) {
   // get the current number of seconds
   *par = time( NULL );

   return;
}
```

The function which can accept a pointer, can also accept an array (As passing an array to function passes the pointer to the first element). Here is an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// function declaration:
double getAverage(int *arr, int size);

int main () {
   // an int array with 5 elements.
   int balance[5] = {1000, 2, 3, 17, 50};
   double avg;

   // pass pointer to the array as an argument.
   avg = getAverage( balance, 5 ) ;

   // output the returned value
   cout << "Average value is: " << avg << endl;

   return 0;
}

double getAverage(int *arr, int size) {
   int i, sum = 0;
   double avg;

   for (i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
      sum += arr[i];
   }
   avg = double(sum) / size;

   return avg;
}
```

## \***\*Return Pointer from Functions\*\***

We can return a pointer from a function. To do so

, you would have to declare a function returning a pointer as in the following example −

```cpp
int * myFunction() {
   .
   .
   .
}
```

Now, consider the following function, which will generate 10 random numbers and return them using an array name which represents a pointer i.e., address of first array element.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ctime>

using namespace std;

// function to generate and retrun random numbers.
int * getRandom( ) {
   static int  r[10];

   // set the seed
   srand( (unsigned)time( NULL ) );

   for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
      r[i] = rand();
      cout << r[i] << endl;
   }

   return r;
}

// main function to call above defined function.
int main () {
   // a pointer to an int.
   int *p;

   p = getRandom();
   for ( int i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
      cout << "*(p + " << i << ") : ";
      cout << *(p + i) << endl;
   }

   return 0;
}
```

When the above code is compiled together and executed, it produces result something as follows −

```
624723190
1468735695
807113585
976495677
613357504

1530315259
1778906708
1820354158
667126415
*(p + 0) : 624723190
*(p + 1) : 1468735695
*(p + 2) : 807113585
*(p + 3) : 976495677
*(p + 4) : 613357504
