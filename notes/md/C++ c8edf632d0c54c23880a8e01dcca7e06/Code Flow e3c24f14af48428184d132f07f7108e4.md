# Operators

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. C++ is rich in built-in operators and provide the following types of operators −

- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Misc Operators

| Operator | Description                                                                                                                     | Example               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| ==       | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.                                      | (A == B) is not true. |
| !=       | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.                     | (A != B) is true.     |

| <=       | Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.    | (A <= B) is true.     |

## \***\*Logical Operators\*\***

| Operator | Description                                                                                                                                       | Example            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- | --- | ----------- |
| &&       | Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then condition becomes true.                                                      | (A && B) is false. |

If any of the two operands is non-zero, then condition becomes true. | (A  |     | B) is true. |
| !        | Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make false. | !(A && B) is true. |

| <<       | Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.   | A << 2 will give 240 which is 1111 0000                                                      |
| >>       | Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand. | A >> 2 will give 15 which is 0000 1111                                                       |

# Loops

## `while` Loop

Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body. Here is the syntax:

```cpp
while(condition) {
   statement(s);
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
   // Local variable declaration:
   int a = 10;

   // while loop execution
   while( a < 20 ) {
      cout << "value of a: " << a << endl;
      a++;
   }

   return 0;
}
```

## `for` Loop

Execute a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.

The syntax of a for loop in C++ is −

```cpp
for ( init; condition; increment ) {
   statement(s);
}
```

Here is the flow of control in a for loop −

- The **init** step is executed first, and only once. This step allows you to declare and initialize any loop control variables. You are not required to put a statement here, as long as a semicolon appears.
- Next, the **condition** is evaluated. If it is true, the body of the loop is executed. If it is false, the body of the loop does not execute and flow of control jumps to the next statement just after the for loop.
- After the body of the for loop executes, the flow of control jumps back up to the **increment** statement. This statement can be left blank, as long as a semicolon appears after the condition.
- The condition is now evaluated again. If it is true, the loop executes and the process repeats itself (body of loop, then increment step, and then again condition). After the condition becomes false, the for loop terminates.

![https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/images/cpp_for_loop.jpg](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/images/cpp_for_loop.jpg)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
   // for loop execution
   for( int a = 10; a < 20; a = a + 1 ) {
      cout << "value of a: " << a << endl;
   }

   return 0;
}
```

## `do...while` Loop

Like a ‘while’ statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.

Unlike **for** and **while** loops, which test the loop condition at the top of the loop, the **do...while** loop checks its condition at the bottom of the loop.

A **do...while** loop is similar to a while loop, except that a do...while loop is guaranteed to execute at least one time.

Here is the syntax:

```cpp
do {
   statement(s);
}
while( condition );
```

## \***\*Loop Control Statements\*\***

Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.

C++ supports the following control statements.

### `break` Statement

When the **break** statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
   // Local variable declaration:
   int a = 10;

   // do loop execution
   do {
      cout << "value of a: " << a << endl;
      a = a + 1;
      if( a > 15) {
         // terminate the loop
         break;
      }
   } while( a < 20 );

   return 0;
}
```

### `continue` Statement

The **continue** statement works somewhat like the break statement. Instead of forcing termination, however, continue forces the next iteration of the loop to take place, skipping any code in between.

### **The Infinite Loop**

A loop becomes infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The **for** loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the ‘for’ loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
   for( ; ; ) {
      printf("This loop will run forever.\n");
   }

   return 0;
}
```

The syntax of an if statement in C++ is −

```cpp
if(boolean_expression) {
   // statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is true
}

```

Example `if`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
   // local variable declaration:
   int a = 10;

   // check the boolean condition
   if( a < 20 ) {
      // if condition is true then print the following
      cout << "a is less than 20;" << endl;
   }
   cout << "value of a is : " << a << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

Example `if..else`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
   // local variable declaration:
   int a = 100;

   // check the boolean condition
   if( a < 20 ) {
      // if condition is true then print the following
      cout << "a is less than 20;" << endl;
   } else {
      // if condition is false then print the following
      cout << "a is not less than 20;" << endl;
   }
   cout << "value of a is : " << a << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

Example `if..else if..else`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
   // local variable declaration:
   int a = 100;

   // check the boolean condition
   if( a == 10 ) {
      // if condition is true then print the following
      cout << "Value of a is 10" << endl;
   } else if( a == 20 ) {
      // if else if condition is true
      cout << "Value of a is 20" << endl;
   } else if( a == 30 ) {
      // if else if condition is true
      cout << "Value of a is 30" << endl;
   } else {
      // if none of the conditions is true
      cout << "Value of a is not matching" << endl;
   }
   cout << "Exact value of a is : " << a << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

Example `switch`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
   // local variable declaration:
   char grade = 'D';

   switch(grade) {
      case 'A' :
         cout << "Excellent!" << endl;
         break;
      case 'B' :
      case 'C' :
         cout << "Well done" << endl;
         break;
      case 'D' :
         cout << "You passed" << endl;
         break;
      case 'F' :
         cout << "Better try again" << endl;
         break;
      default :
         cout << "Invalid grade" << endl;
   }
   cout << "Your grade is " << grade << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

## \***\*Conditional ? : Operator\*\***

The syntax is

```cpp
if(condition) {
   var = X;
} else {
   var = Y;
}
```

Here is an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
   // Local variable declaration:
   int x, y = 10;

   x = (y < 10) ? 30 : 40;
   cout << "value of x: " << x << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

# Functions

The general form of a C++ function definition is as follows −

```cpp
return_type function_name( parameter list ) {
   body of the function
}

```

A C++ function definition consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function −

- **Return Type** − A function may return a value. The **return_type** is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword **void**.
- **Function Name** − This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
- **Parameters** − A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
- **Function Body** − The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.

Here is an example

```cpp
// function returning the max between two numbers

int max(int num1, int num2) {
   // local variable declaration
   int result;

   if (num1 > num2)
      result = num1;
   else
      result = num2;

   return result;
}
```

## **Function Declarations**

A function **declaration** tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.

A function declaration has the following parts −

```cpp
return_type function_name( parameter list );
```

For the above defined function max(), following is the function declaration −

```cpp
int max(int num1, int num2);
```

Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so following is also valid declaration −

```cpp
int max(int, int);
```

Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.

## **Calling a Function**

While creating a C++ function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call or invoke that function.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// function declaration
int max(int num1, int num2);

int main () {
   // local variable declaration:
   int a = 100;
   int b = 200;
   int ret;

   // calling a function to get max value.
   ret = max(a, b);
   cout << "Max value is : " << ret << endl;

   return 0;
}

// function returning the max between two numbers
int max(int num1, int num2) {
   // local variable declaration
   int result;

   if (num1 > num2)
      result = num1;
   else
      result = num2;

   return result;
}
```

## **Function Arguments**

If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the **formal parameters** of the function.

The formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.

While calling a function, there are two ways that arguments can be passed to a function −

| This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.                                            |

| This method copies the reference of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the reference is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument. |

### Call by Value

The **call by value** method of passing arguments to a function copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.

By default, C++ uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, this means that code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

Consider the function `swap()` definition as follows.

```cpp
// function definition to swap the values.
void swap(int x, int y) {
   int temp;

   temp = x; /* save the value of x */
   x = y;    /* put y into x */
   y = temp; /* put x into y */

   return;
}
```

This function can not change the values of `x` and `y` passed to it.

### Call by Pointer

The **call by pointer** method of passing arguments to a function copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the passed argument.

To pass the value by pointer, argument pointers are passed to the functions just like any other value. So accordingly you need to declare the function parameters as pointer types. See example below:

```cpp
// function definition to swap the values.
void swap(int *x, int *y) {
   int temp;
   temp = *x; /* save the value at address x */
   *x = *y; /* put y into x */
   *y = temp; /* put x into y */

   return;
}
```

Here is a functon which uses the `swap` function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// function declaration
void swap(int *x, int *y);

int main () {
   // local variable declaration:
   int a = 100;
   int b = 200;

   cout << "Before swap, value of a :" << a << endl;
   cout << "Before swap, value of b :" << b << endl;

   /* calling a function to swap the values.
      * &a indicates pointer to a ie. address of variable a and
      * &b indicates pointer to b ie. address of variable b.
   */
   swap(&a, &b);

   cout << "After swap, value of a :" << a << endl;
   cout << "After swap, value of b :" << b << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

### Call by Reference

The **call by reference** method of passing arguments to a function copies the reference of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the reference is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the passed argument.

To pass the value by reference, argument reference is passed to the functions just like any other value. So accordingly you need to declare the function parameters as reference types as in the following function **swap()**, which exchanges the values of the two integer variables pointed to by its arguments.

```cpp
// function definition to swap the values.
void swap(int &x, int &y) {
   int temp;
   temp = x; /* save the value at address x */
   x = y;    /* put y into x */
   y = temp; /* put x into y */

   return;
}
```

This function also swaps the values of `x` and `y`.

## \***\*Default Values for Parameters\*\***

When you define a function, you can specify a default value for each of the last parameters. This value will be used if the corresponding argument is left blank when calling to the function.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int sum(int a, int b = 20) {
   int result;
   result = a + b;

   return (result);
}
int main () {
   // local variable declaration:
   int a = 100;
   int b = 200;
   int result;

   // calling a function to add the values.
   result = sum(a, b);
   cout << "Total value is :" << result << endl;

   // calling a function again as follows.
   result = sum(a);
   cout << "Total value is :" << result << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:

```
Total value is :300
Total value is :120
```
