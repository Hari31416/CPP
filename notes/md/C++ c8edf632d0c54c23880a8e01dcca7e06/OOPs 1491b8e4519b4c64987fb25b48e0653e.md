# Class

A class is used to specify the form of an object and it combines data representation and methods for manipulating that data into one neat package. The data and functions within a class are called members of the class.

## **C++ Class Definitions**

When you define a class, you define a blueprint for a data type. This doesn't actually define any data, but it does define what the class name means, that is, what an object of the class will consist of and what operations can be performed on such an object. Here is the syntax:

```cpp
class Box {
   public:
      double length;   // Length of a box
      double breadth;  // Breadth of a box
      double height;   // Height of a box
};

```

The keyword **public** determines the access attributes of the members of the class that follows it. A public member can be accessed from outside the class anywhere within the scope of the class object. You can also specify the members of a class as **private** or **protected.**

## **Define C++ Objects**

A class provides the blueprints for objects, so basically an object is created from a class. We declare objects of a class with exactly the same sort of declaration that we declare variables of basic types:

```cpp
Box Box1;          // Declare Box1 of type Box
Box Box2;          // Declare Box2 of type Box
```

Both of the objects Box1 and Box2 will have their own copy of data members.

## **Accessing the Data Members**

The public data members of objects of a class can be accessed using the direct member access operator (.):

## \***\*Class Member Functions\*\***

A member function of a class is a function that has its definition or its prototype within the class definition like any other variable. It operates on any object of the class of which it is a member, and has access to all the members of a class for that object:

```cpp
class Box {
   public:
      double length;      // Length of a box
      double breadth;     // Breadth of a box
      double height;      // Height of a box

      double getVolume(void) {
         return length * breadth * height;
      }
};
```

If you like, you can define the same function outside the class using the **scope resolution operator** (::) as follows −

```cpp
double Box::getVolume(void) {
   return length * breadth * height;
}
```

Here is a complete example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Box {
   public:
      double length;         // Length of a box
      double breadth;        // Breadth of a box
      double height;         // Height of a box

      // Member functions declaration
      double getVolume(void);
      void setLength( double len );
      void setBreadth( double bre );
      void setHeight( double hei );
};

// Member functions definitions
double Box::getVolume(void) {
   return length * breadth * height;
}

void Box::setLength( double len ) {
   length = len;
}
void Box::setBreadth( double bre ) {
   breadth = bre;
}
void Box::setHeight( double hei ) {
   height = hei;
}

// Main function for the program
int main() {
   Box Box1;                // Declare Box1 of type Box
   Box Box2;                // Declare Box2 of type Box
   double volume = 0.0;     // Store the volume of a box here

   // box 1 specification
   Box1.setLength(6.0);
   Box1.setBreadth(7.0);
   Box1.setHeight(5.0);

   // box 2 specification
   Box2.setLength(12.0);
   Box2.setBreadth(13.0);
   Box2.setHeight(10.0);

   // volume of box 1
   volume = Box1.getVolume();
   cout << "Volume of Box1 : " << volume <<endl;

   // volume of box 2
   volume = Box2.getVolume();
   cout << "Volume of Box2 : " << volume <<endl;
   return 0;
}
```

## \***\*Class Access Modifiers\*\***

The access restriction to the class members is specified by the labeled **public, private,** and **protected** sections within the class body. The keywords public, private, and protected are called access specifiers.

### **The public Members**

A **public** member is accessible from anywhere outside the class but within a program. You can set and get the value of public variables without any member function.

### **The private Members**

A **private** member variable or function cannot be accessed, or even viewed from outside the class. Only the class and friend functions can access private members.

By default all the members of a class would be private, for example in the following class **width** is a private member, which means until you label a member, it will be assumed a private member −

```cpp
class Box {
   double width;

   public:
      double length;
      void setWidth( double wid );
      double getWidth( void );
};
```

Practically, we define data in private section and related functions in public section so that they can be called from outside of the class as shown in the following program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Box {
   public:
      double length;
      void setWidth( double wid );
      double getWidth( void );

   private:
      double width;
};

// Member functions definitions
double Box::getWidth(void) {
   return width ;
}

void Box::setWidth( double wid ) {
   width = wid;
}

// Main function for the program
int main() {
   Box box;

   // set box length without member function
   box.length = 10.0; // OK: because length is public
   cout << "Length of box : " << box.length <<endl;

   // set box width without member function
   // box.width = 10.0; // Error: because width is private
   box.setWidth(10.0);  // Use member function to set it.
   cout << "Width of box : " << box.getWidth() <<endl;

   return 0;
}
```

### **The protected Members**

A **protected** member variable or function is very similar to a private member but it provided one additional benefit that they can be accessed in child classes which are called derived classes.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Box {
   protected:
      double width;
};

class SmallBox:Box { // SmallBox is the derived class.
   public:
      void setSmallWidth( double wid );
      double getSmallWidth( void );
};

// Member functions of child class
double SmallBox::getSmallWidth(void) {
   return width ;
}

void SmallBox::setSmallWidth( double wid ) {
   width = wid;
}

// Main function for the program
int main() {
   SmallBox box;

   // set box width using member function
   box.setSmallWidth(5.0);
   cout << "Width of box : "<< box.getSmallWidth() << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

## **The Class Constructor**

A class **constructor** is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever we create new objects of that class.

A constructor will have exact same name as the class and it does not have any return type at all, not even void. Constructors can be very useful for setting initial values for certain member variables.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Line {
   public:
      void setLength( double len );
      double getLength( void );
      Line();  // This is the constructor
   private:
      double length;
};

// Member functions definitions including constructor
Line::Line(void) {
   cout << "Object is being created" << endl;
}
void Line::setLength( double len ) {
   length = len;
}
double Line::getLength( void ) {
   return length;
}

// Main function for the program
int main() {
   Line line;

   // set line length
   line.setLength(6.0);
   cout << "Length of line : " << line.getLength() <<endl;

   return 0;
}
```

### **Parameterized Constructor**

A default constructor does not have any parameter, but if you need, a constructor can have parameters. This helps you to assign initial value to an object at the time of its creation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
class Line {
   public:
      void setLength( double len );
      double getLength( void );
      Line(double len);  // This is the constructor

   private:
      double length;
};

// Member functions definitions including constructor
Line::Line( double len) {
   cout << "Object is being created, length = " << len << endl;
   length = len;
}
void Line::setLength( double len ) {
   length = len;
}
double Line::getLength( void ) {
   return length;
}

// Main function for the program
int main() {
   Line line(10.0);

   // get initially set length.
   cout << "Length of line : " << line.getLength() <<endl;

   // set line length again
   line.setLength(6.0);
   cout << "Length of line : " << line.getLength() <<endl;

   return 0;
}
```

### **Using Initialization Lists to Initialize Fields**

In case of parameterized constructor, you can use following syntax to initialize the fields −

```cpp
Line::Line( double len): length(len) {
   cout << "Object is being created, length = " << len << endl;
}
```

Above syntax is equal to the following syntax −

```cpp
Line::Line( double len) {
   cout << "Object is being created, length = " << len << endl;
   length = len;
}
```

If for a class C, you have multiple fields X, Y, Z, etc., to be initialized, then use can use same syntax and separate the fields by comma as follows −

```cpp
C::C( double a, double b, double c): X(a), Y(b), Z(c) {
   ....
}
```

### **The Class Destructor**

A **destructor** is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever an object of it's class goes out of scope or whenever the delete expression is applied to a pointer to the object of that class.

A destructor will have exact same name as the class prefixed with a tilde (~) and it can neither return a value nor can it take any parameters. Destructor can be very useful for releasing resources before coming out of the program like closing files, releasing memories etc.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
class Line {
   public:
      void setLength( double len );
      double getLength( void );
      Line();   // This is the constructor declaration
      ~Line();  // This is the destructor: declaration

   private:
      double length;
};

// Member functions definitions including constructor
Line::Line(void) {
   cout << "Object is being created" << endl;
}
Line::~Line(void) {
   cout << "Object is being deleted" << endl;
}
void Line::setLength( double len ) {
   length = len;
}
double Line::getLength( void ) {
   return length;
}

// Main function for the program
int main() {
   Line line;

   // set line length
   line.setLength(6.0);
   cout << "Length of line : " << line.getLength() <<endl;

   return 0;
}
```

## \***\*Friend Functions\*\***

A friend function of a class is defined outside that class' scope but it has the right to access all private and protected members of the class. Even though the prototypes for friend functions appear in the class definition, friends are not member functions.

To declare a function as a friend of a class, precede the function prototype in the class definition with keyword **friend** as follows −

```cpp
class Box {
   double width;

   public:
      double length;
      friend void printWidth( Box box );
      void setWidth( double wid );
};
```

Here is a full example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Box {
   double width;

   public:
      friend void printWidth( Box box );
      void setWidth( double wid );
};

// Member function definition
void Box::setWidth( double wid ) {
   width = wid;
}

// Note: printWidth() is not a member function of any class.
void printWidth( Box box ) {
   /* Because printWidth() is a friend of Box, it can
   directly access any member of this class */
   cout << "Width of box : " << box.width <<endl;
}

// Main function for the program
int main() {
   Box box;

   // set box width without member function
   box.setWidth(10.0);

   // Use friend function to print the wdith.
   printWidth( box );

   return 0;
}
```

## `this` Pointer

Every object in C++ has access to its own address through an important pointer called **this** pointer. The **this** pointer is an implicit parameter to all member functions. Therefore, inside a member function, `this` may be used to refer to the invoking object.

Friend functions do not have a **this** pointer, because friends are not members of a class. Only member functions have a **this** pointer.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Box {
   public:
      // Constructor definition
      Box(double l = 2.0, double b = 2.0, double h = 2.0) {
         cout <<"Constructor called." << endl;
         length = l;
         breadth = b;
         height = h;
      }
      double Volume() {
         return length * breadth * height;
      }
      int compare(Box box) {
         return this->Volume() > box.Volume();
      }

   private:
      double length;     // Length of a box
      double breadth;    // Breadth of a box
      double height;     // Height of a box
};

int main(void) {
   Box Box1(3.3, 1.2, 1.5);    // Declare box1
   Box Box2(8.5, 6.0, 2.0);    // Declare box2

   if(Box1.compare(Box2)) {
      cout << "Box2 is smaller than Box1" <<endl;
   } else {
      cout << "Box2 is equal to or larger than Box1" <<endl;
   }

   return 0;
}
```

The output is

```
Constructor called.
Constructor called.
Box2 is equal to or larger than Box1
```

## Pointer to Class

A pointer to a C++ class is done exactly the same way as a pointer to a structure and to access members of a pointer to a class you use the member access operator **`->`** operator, just as you do with pointers to structures. Also as with all pointers, you must initialize the pointer before using it.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Box {
   public:
      // Constructor definition
      Box(double l = 2.0, double b = 2.0, double h = 2.0) {
         cout <<"Constructor called." << endl;
         length = l;
         breadth = b;
         height = h;
      }
      double Volume() {
         return length * breadth * height;
      }

   private:
      double length;     // Length of a box
      double breadth;    // Breadth of a box
      double height;     // Height of a box
};

int main(void) {
   Box Box1(3.3, 1.2, 1.5);    // Declare box1
   Box Box2(8.5, 6.0, 2.0);    // Declare box2
   Box *ptrBox;                // Declare pointer to a class.

   // Save the address of first object
   ptrBox = &Box1;

   // Now try to access a member using member access operator
   cout << "Volume of Box1: " << ptrBox->Volume() << endl;

   // Save the address of second object
   ptrBox = &Box2;

   // Now try to access a member using member access operator
   cout << "Volume of Box2: " << ptrBox->Volume() << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

The output, as expected is

```
Constructor called.
Constructor called.
Volume of Box1: 5.94
Volume of Box2: 102
```

## \***\*Static Members\*\***

We can define class members static using **static** keyword. When we declare a member of a class as static it means no matter how many objects of the class are created, there is only one copy of the static member.

A static member is shared by all objects of the class. All static data is initialized to zero when the first object is created, if no other initialization is present. We can't put it in the class definition but it can be initialized outside the class as done in the following example by redeclaring the static variable, using the scope resolution operator **`::`** to identify which class it belongs to.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Box {
   public:
      static int objectCount;

      // Constructor definition
      Box(double l = 2.0, double b = 2.0, double h = 2.0) {
         cout <<"Constructor called." << endl;
         length = l;
         breadth = b;
         height = h;

         // Increase every time object is created
         objectCount++;
      }
      double Volume() {
         return length * breadth * height;
      }

   private:
      double length;     // Length of a box
      double breadth;    // Breadth of a box
      double height;     // Height of a box
};

// Initialize static member of class Box
int Box::objectCount = 0;

int main(void) {
   Box Box1(3.3, 1.2, 1.5);    // Declare box1
   Box Box2(8.5, 6.0, 2.0);    // Declare box2

   // Print total number of objects.
   cout << "Total objects: " << Box::objectCount << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

The output is

```
Constructor called.
Constructor called.
Total objects: 2
```

## **Static Function Members**

By declaring a function member as static, you make it independent of any particular object of the class. A static member function can be called even if no objects of the class exist and the **static** functions are accessed using only the class name and the scope resolution operator **`::`**.

A static member function can only access static data member, other static member functions and any other functions from outside the class. Static member functions have a class scope and they do not have access to the **this** pointer of the class.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Box {
   public:
      static int objectCount;

      // Constructor definition
      Box(double l = 2.0, double b = 2.0, double h = 2.0) {
         cout <<"Constructor called." << endl;
         length = l;
         breadth = b;
         height = h;

         // Increase every time object is created
         objectCount++;
      }
      double Volume() {
         return length * breadth * height;
      }
      static int getCount() {
         return objectCount;
      }

   private:
      double length;     // Length of a box
      double breadth;    // Breadth of a box
      double height;     // Height of a box
};

// Initialize static member of class Box
int Box::objectCount = 0;

int main(void) {
   // Print total number of objects before creating object.
   cout << "Inital Stage Count: " << Box::getCount() << endl;

   Box Box1(3.3, 1.2, 1.5);    // Declare box1
   Box Box2(8.5, 6.0, 2.0);    // Declare box2

   // Print total number of objects after creating object.
   cout << "Final Stage Count: " << Box::getCount() << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

The output is

```
Inital Stage Count: 0
Constructor called.
Constructor called.
Final Stage Count: 2
```

# Inheritance

The idea of inheritance implements a **`is a`** relationship. For example, mammal IS-A animal, dog IS-A mammal hence dog IS-A animal as well and so on.

## \***\*Base and Derived Classes\*\***

A class can be derived from more than one classes, which means it can inherit data and functions from multiple base classes. To define a derived class, we use a class derivation list to specify the base class(es). A class derivation list names one or more base classes and has the form −

```
class derived-class: access-specifier base-class
```

Where access-specifier is one of **public, protected,** or **private**, and base-class is the name of a previously defined class. If the access-specifier is not used, then it is private by default.

Consider a base class **Shape** and its derived class **Rectangle** as follows −

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Base class
class Shape {
   public:
      void setWidth(int w) {
         width = w;
      }
      void setHeight(int h) {
         height = h;
      }

   protected:
      int width;
      int height;
};

// Derived class
class Rectangle: public Shape {
   public:
      int getArea() {
         return (width * height);
      }
};

int main(void) {
   Rectangle Rect;

   Rect.setWidth(5);
   Rect.setHeight(7);

   // Print the area of the object.
   cout << "Total area: " << Rect.getArea() << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −

```
Total area: 35
```

## \***\*Access Control and Inheritance\*\***

We can summarize the different access types according to - who can access them in the following way −

| Access          | public | protected | private |
| --------------- | ------ | --------- | ------- |
| Same class      | yes    | yes       | yes     |
| Derived classes | yes    | yes       | no      |
| Outside classes | yes    | no        | no      |

A derived class inherits all base class methods with the following exceptions −

- Constructors, destructors and copy constructors of the base class.
- Overloaded operators of the base class.
- The friend functions of the base class.

## **Type of Inheritance**

When deriving a class from a base class, the base class may be inherited through **public, protected** or **private** inheritance. The type of inheritance is specified by the access-specifier as explained above.

- **Public Inheritance** − When deriving a class from a **public** base class, **public** members of the base class become **public** members of the derived class and **protected** members of the base class become **protected** members of the derived class. A base class's **private** members are never accessible directly from a derived class, but can be accessed through calls to the **public** and **protected** members of the base class.
- **Protected Inheritance** − When deriving from a **protected** base class, **public** and **protected** members of the base class become **protected** members of the derived class.
- **Private Inheritance** − When deriving from a **private** base class, **public** and **protected** members of the base class become **private** members of the derived class.

## **Multiple Inheritance**

A C++ class can inherit members from more than one class and here is the extended syntax −

```cpp
class derived-class: access baseA, access baseB...
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Base class Shape
class Shape {
   public:
      void setWidth(int w) {
         width = w;
      }
      void setHeight(int h) {
         height = h;
      }

   protected:
      int width;
      int height;
};

// Base class PaintCost
class PaintCost {
   public:
      int getCost(int area) {
         return area * 70;
      }
};

// Derived class
class Rectangle: public Shape, public PaintCost {
   public:
      int getArea() {
         return (width * height);
      }
};

int main(void) {
   Rectangle Rect;
   int area;

   Rect.setWidth(5);
   Rect.setHeight(7);

   area = Rect.getArea();

   // Print the area of the object.
   cout << "Total area: " << Rect.getArea() << endl;

   // Print the total cost of painting
   cout << "Total paint cost: $" << Rect.getCost(area) << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

# \***\*Overloading\*\***

C++ allows you to specify more than one definition for a **function** name or an **operator** in the same scope, which is called **function overloading** and **operator overloading** respectively.

An overloaded declaration is a declaration that is declared with the same name as a previously declared declaration in the same scope, except that both declarations have different arguments and obviously different definition (implementation).

## \***\*Function Overloading\*\***

You can have multiple definitions for the same function name in the same scope. The definition of the function must differ from each other by the types and/or the number of arguments in the argument list. You cannot overload function declarations that differ only by return type.

Following is the example where same function **print()** is being used to print different data types:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class printData {
   public:
      void print(int i) {
        cout << "Printing int: " << i << endl;
      }
      void print(double  f) {
        cout << "Printing float: " << f << endl;
      }
      void print(char* c) {
        cout << "Printing character: " << c << endl;
      }
};

int main(void) {
   printData pd;

   // Call print to print integer
   pd.print(5);

   // Call print to print float
   pd.print(500.263);

   // Call print to print character
   pd.print("Hello C++");

   return 0;
}
```

## \***\*Operators Overloading\*\***

You can redefine or overload most of the built-in operators available in C++. Thus, a programmer can use operators with user-defined types as well.

Overloaded operators are functions with special names: the keyword "operator" followed by the symbol for the operator being defined. Like any other function, an overloaded operator has a return type and a parameter list.

```cpp
Box operator+(const Box&);
```

Here is an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Box {
   public:
      double getVolume(void) {
         return length * breadth * height;
      }
      void setLength( double len ) {
         length = len;
      }
      void setBreadth( double bre ) {
         breadth = bre;
      }
      void setHeight( double hei ) {
         height = hei;
      }

      // Overload + operator to add two Box objects.
      Box operator+(const Box& b) {
         Box box;
         box.length = this->length + b.length;
         box.breadth = this->breadth + b.breadth;
         box.height = this->height + b.height;
         return box;
      }

   private:
      double length;      // Length of a box
      double breadth;     // Breadth of a box
      double height;      // Height of a box
};

// Main function for the program
int main() {
   Box Box1;                // Declare Box1 of type Box
   Box Box2;                // Declare Box2 of type Box
   Box Box3;                // Declare Box3 of type Box
   double volume = 0.0;     // Store the volume of a box here

   // box 1 specification
   Box1.setLength(6.0);
   Box1.setBreadth(7.0);
   Box1.setHeight(5.0);

   // box 2 specification
   Box2.setLength(12.0);
   Box2.setBreadth(13.0);
   Box2.setHeight(10.0);

   // volume of box 1
   volume = Box1.getVolume();
   cout << "Volume of Box1 : " << volume <<endl;

   // volume of box 2
   volume = Box2.getVolume();
   cout << "Volume of Box2 : " << volume <<endl;

   // Add two object as follows:
   Box3 = Box1 + Box2;

   // volume of box 3
   volume = Box3.getVolume();
   cout << "Volume of Box3 : " << volume <<endl;

   return 0;
}
```

### \***\*Overloadable/Non-overloadable Operators\*\***

Following is the list of operators which can be overloaded −

| +   | -    | \*  | /      | %      | ^         |
| --- | ---- | --- | ------ | ------ | --------- | --- | --- |
| &   |      |     | ~      | !      | ,         | =   |
| <   | >    | <=  | >=     | ++     | --        |
| <<  | >>   | ==  | !=     | &&     |           |     |     |
| +=  | -=   | /=  | %=     | ^=     | &=        |
|     | =    | \*= | <<=    | >>=    | []        | ()  |
| ->  | ->\* | new | new [] | delete | delete [] |

Following is the list of operators, which can not be overloaded −

| ::  | .\* | .   | ?:  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Here are some more examples:

### Negation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Distance {
   private:
      int feet;             // 0 to infinite
      int inches;           // 0 to 12

   public:
      // required constructors
      Distance() {
         feet = 0;
         inches = 0;
      }
      Distance(int f, int i) {
         feet = f;
         inches = i;
      }

      // method to display distance
      void displayDistance() {
         cout << "F: " << feet << " I:" << inches <<endl;
      }

      // overloaded minus (-) operator
      Distance operator- () {
         feet = -feet;
         inches = -inches;
         return Distance(feet, inches);
      }
};

int main() {
   Distance D1(11, 10), D2(-5, 11);

   -D1;                     // apply negation
   D1.displayDistance();    // display D1

   -D2;                     // apply negation
   D2.displayDistance();    // display D2

   return 0;
}
```

### \***\*Increment `++` & Decrement `--`**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Time {
   private:
      int hours;             // 0 to 23
      int minutes;           // 0 to 59

   public:
      // required constructors
      Time() {
         hours = 0;
         minutes = 0;
      }
      Time(int h, int m) {
         hours = h;
         minutes = m;
      }

      // method to display time
      void displayTime() {
         cout << "H: " << hours << " M:" << minutes <<endl;
      }

      // overloaded prefix ++ operator
      Time operator++ () {
         ++minutes;          // increment this object
         if(minutes >= 60) {
            ++hours;
            minutes -= 60;
         }
         return Time(hours, minutes);
      }

      // overloaded postfix ++ operator
      Time operator++( int ) {

         // save the orignal value
         Time T(hours, minutes);

         // increment this object
         ++minutes;

         if(minutes >= 60) {
            ++hours;
            minutes -= 60;
         }

         // return old original value
         return T;
      }
};

int main() {
   Time T1(11, 59), T2(10,40);

   ++T1;                    // increment T1
   T1.displayTime();        // display T1
   ++T1;                    // increment T1 again
   T1.displayTime();        // display T1

   T2++;                    // increment T2
   T2.displayTime();        // display T2
   T2++;                    // increment T2 again
   T2.displayTime();        // display T2
   return 0;
}
```

The output will be

```
H: 12 M:0
H: 12 M:1
H: 10 M:41
H: 10 M:42
```

### \***\*Relational Operators\*\***

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Distance {
   private:
      int feet;             // 0 to infinite
      int inches;           // 0 to 12

   public:
      // required constructors
      Distance() {
         feet = 0;
         inches = 0;
      }
      Distance(int f, int i) {
         feet = f;
         inches = i;
      }

      // method to display distance
      void displayDistance() {
         cout << "F: " << feet << " I:" << inches <<endl;
      }

      // overloaded minus (-) operator
      Distance operator- () {
         feet = -feet;
         inches = -inches;
         return Distance(feet, inches);
      }

      // overloaded < operator
      bool operator <(const Distance& d) {
         if(feet < d.feet) {
            return true;
         }
         if(feet == d.feet && inches < d.inches) {
            return true;
         }

         return false;
      }
};

int main() {
   Distance D1(11, 10), D2(5, 11);

   if( D1 < D2 ) {
      cout << "D1 is less than D2 " << endl;
   } else {
      cout << "D2 is less than D1 " << endl;
   }

   return 0;
}
```

Here is the output:

`D2 is less than D1`

### \***\*Function Call Operator `()`**

The function call operator `()` can be overloaded for objects of class type. When you overload `()`, you are not creating a new way to call a function. Rather, you are creating an operator function that can be passed an arbitrary number of parameters.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Distance {
   private:
      int feet;             // 0 to infinite
      int inches;           // 0 to 12

   public:
      // required constructors
      Distance() {
         feet = 0;
         inches = 0;
      }
      Distance(int f, int i) {
         feet = f;
         inches = i;
      }

      // overload function call
      Distance operator()(int a, int b, int c) {
         Distance D;

         // just put random calculation
         D.feet = a + c + 10;
         D.inches = b + c + 100 ;
         return D;
      }

      // method to display distance
      void displayDistance() {
         cout << "F: " << feet << " I:" << inches << endl;
      }
};

int main() {
   Distance D1(11, 10), D2;

   cout << "First Distance : ";
   D1.displayDistance();

   D2 = D1(10, 10, 10); // invoke operator()
   cout << "Second Distance :";
   D2.displayDistance();

   return 0;
}
```

```
First Distance : F: 11 I:10
Second Distance :F: 30 I:120
```

# \***\*Polymorphism\*\***

C++ polymorphism means that a call to a member function will cause a different function to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the function. Here is a simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Shape {
   protected:
      int width, height;

   public:
      Shape( int a = 0, int b = 0){
         width = a;
         height = b;
      }
      virtual int area() {
         cout << "Parent class area :" << width * height << endl;
         return width * height;
      }
};
class Rectangle: public Shape {
   public:
      Rectangle( int a = 0, int b = 0):Shape(a, b) { }

      int area () {
         cout << "Rectangle class area :" << width * height << endl;
         return (width * height);
      }
};

class Triangle: public Shape {
   public:
      Triangle( int a = 0, int b = 0):Shape(a, b) { }

      int area () {
         cout << "Triangle class area :" << (width * height)/2 << endl;
         return (width * height / 2);
      }
};

// Main function for the program
int main() {
   Shape *shape;
   Rectangle rec(10,7);
   Triangle  tri(10,5);

   // store the address of Rectangle
   shape = &rec;

   // call rectangle area.
   shape->area();

   // store the address of Triangle
   shape = &tri;

   // call triangle area.
   shape->area();

   return 0;
}
```

Note the use of `virtual` keyword in the base class definition.

## \***\*Virtual Function\*\***

A **virtual** function is a function in a base class that is declared using the keyword **`virtual`**. Defining in a base class a virtual function, with another version in a derived class, signals to the compiler that we don't want _static linkage_ for this function.

What we do want is the selection of the function to be called at any given point in the program to be based on the kind of object for which it is called. This sort of operation is referred to as **_dynamic linkage_**, or **_late binding_**.

## \***\*Pure Virtual Functions\*\***

It is possible that you want to include a virtual function in a base class so that it may be redefined in a derived class to suit the objects of that class, but that there is no meaningful definition you could give for the function in the base class. For this, rewrite the virtual function as:

```cpp
class Shape {
   protected:
      int width, height;

   public:
      Shape(int a = 0, int b = 0) {
         width = a;
         height = b;
      }

      // pure virtual function
      virtual int area() = 0;
};
```

The `= 0` tells the compiler that the function has no body and above virtual function will be called **pure virtual function.**

# \***\*Abstraction\*\***

Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding their background details, i.e., to represent the needed information in program without presenting the details.

In C++, we use **classes** to define our own abstract data types (ADT). For example, you can use the **`cout`** object of class **`ostream`** to stream data to standard output like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   cout << "Hello C++" <<endl;
   return 0;
}
```

Here, you don't need to understand how **`cout`** displays the text on the user's screen. You need to only know the public interface and the underlying implementation of `cout` is free to change. Here is another simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Adder {
   public:
      // constructor
      Adder(int i = 0) {
         total = i;
      }

      // interface to outside world
      void addNum(int number) {
         total += number;
      }

      // interface to outside world
      int getTotal() {
         return total;
      };

   private:
      // hidden data from outside world
      int total;
};

int main() {
   Adder a;

   a.addNum(10);
   a.addNum(20);
   a.addNum(30);

   cout << "Total " << a.getTotal() <<endl;
   return 0;
}
```

Above class adds numbers together, and returns the sum. The public members - **`addNum`** and **`getTotal`** are the interfaces to the outside world and a user needs to know them to use the class. The private member **`total`** is something that the user doesn't need to know about, but is needed for the class to operate properly.

# \***\*Encapsulation\*\***

All C++ programs are composed of the following two fundamental elements −

- **Program statements (code)** − This is the part of a program that performs actions and they are called functions.
- **Program data** − The data is the information of the program which gets affected by the program functions.

Encapsulation is an Object Oriented Programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Data encapsulation led to the important OOP concept of **data hiding**.

> **Data encapsulation** is a mechanism of bundling the data, and the functions that use them and **data abstraction** is a mechanism of exposing only the interfaces and hiding the implementation details from the user.

The [same example](OOPs%201491b8e4519b4c64987fb25b48e0653e.md) can be used to explain this.

# \***\*Interfaces (Abstract Classes)\*\***

An interface describes the behavior or capabilities of a C++ class without committing to a particular implementation of that class.

The C++ interfaces are implemented using **abstract classes** and these abstract classes should not be confused with data abstraction which is a concept of keeping implementation details separate from associated data.

A class is made abstract by declaring at least one of its functions as **pure virtual** function. A pure virtual function is specified by placing "= 0" in its declaration as follows −

```cpp
class Box {
   public:
      // pure virtual function
      virtual double getVolume() = 0;

   private:
      double length;      // Length of a box
      double breadth;     // Breadth of a box
      double height;      // Height of a box
};

```

The purpose of an **abstract class** (often referred to as an ABC) is to provide an appropriate base class from which other classes can inherit. Abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate objects and serves only as an **interface**. Attempting to instantiate an object of an abstract class causes a compilation error.
